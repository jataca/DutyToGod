    <string name="deaconftsy">The Lord has said that every priesthood holder should “learn his duty” and “act … in all diligence” (D\u0026C 107:99). This section will help you learn and fulfill your duties as a deacon, which are outlined in Doctrine and Covenants 20:57, 59; 84:111. Your duties can be organized into three groups:</string>
    <string name="deaconSSPrayLearn">Carefully study Joshua 1:8; 1 Nephi 15:23–24; 2 Nephi 32:3; Alma 17:2–3; and D\u0026C 21:4–6. In the space below, make a list of words and phrases you find that describe:
\n1. How you should approach your study of the scriptures and words of the living prophets.
\n2. Blessings that will come as you study the scriptures and words of the living prophets.
\nShare your list with your parents, priesthood leaders, or other quorum members. Discuss specific blessings you have received from following counsel the Lord has given in the scriptures and through living prophets.</string>
    <string name="deaconSSPrayAct">In the space below, write your plans to begin or strengthen a habit of regular prayer and scripture study. For example, you could plan to study the Book of Mormon for a specific amount of time each day. Your scripture study could include the words of the living prophets in the conference issues of the Ensign or Liahona.</string>
    <string name="deaconSSPrayShare">Share what you are learning from your scripture study. For example, you could share with your family, with friends, or in quorum meetings. This will strengthen your testimony of what you’re learning and help you learn how to teach the gospel. It will also strengthen the testimony of others.
\nRecord any thoughts or feelings you have about this experience in the space below.</string>
    <string name="deaconSSLiveLearn">Read the section titled “Repentance” in For the Strength of Youth, and write your answers to the following questions in the space below:
\n1. What do you learn about the Atonement and repentance from this section?
\n2. How does repentance help you grow spiritually?
\n3. What is the relationship between repentance, the Atonement, and personal worthiness?
\nDiscuss your answers with your parents or quorum members. Discuss how repentance will help you prepare to enter the temple and participate in sacred ordinances.</string>
    <string name="deaconSSLiveAct">Choose at least three other sections from For the Strength of Youth that will help you live worthily. Study the standards in these sections, and write what you will do to live these standards and to help others do the same.</string>
    <string name="deaconSSLiveShare">After studying and applying these standards, share with your parents or quorum members what you are learning, how it is influencing your life, and the kind of person you are becoming.
\nRecord in the space below any thoughts or feelings you have about this experience.</string>
    <string name="deaconSSUnderstandLearn">Read Doctrine and Covenants 11:21. What promises does the Lord give to those who study His word? Record your thoughts in the box below.
\nYou will need a basic understanding and a testimony of gospel truths to fulfill your duties now as a priesthood holder and in the future as a full-time missionary and as a husband and father.
\nLook at the list of doctrinal topics, and choose four or more that you would like to learn about. One of these should be “The Priesthood and Priesthood Keys.” You can use the scriptures (including the Topical Guide), True to the Faith, Preach My Gospel, and the words of latter-day prophets to learn about these topics.</string>

One of these should be “The Priesthood and Priesthood Keys.” You can use the scriptures (including the Topical Guide), True to the Faith , Preach My Gospel, and the words of latter-day prophets to learn about these topics.
\nFor each topic you study, create a simple outline. It could include: (1) a definition of the topic, (2) teachings and examples from the scriptures and your own life, and (3) your thoughts and feelings about why this topic is important. For examples of outlines, see Preach My Gospel (chapters 2 and 3).
</string>
    <string name="deaconSSUnderstandShare">Using the outlines you have prepared, teach others about these doctrinal topics. Counsel with your parents and quorum leaders to determine when you can do this.
